# SlinkyConnect

**SlinkyConnect** is a companion mobile app for **Slinky**, a stressâ€‘detecting stuffed animal sloth. Using a Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) sensor and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Slinky streams your realâ€‘time stress data to your phone. Monitor stress levels, view historical trends, and activate soothing haptic feedbackâ€”all in one place.

## Features

- **Realâ€‘time Monitoring**  
  â€¢ Start/stop stress detection at the tap of a button  
  â€¢ Live updates of a stress level graph via BLE

- **Historical Analysis**  
  â€¢ Weekly, monthly, and yearly views of average stress  
  â€¢ Colorâ€‘coded bar charts by stressâ€‘level thresholds (Low/Medium/High)  
  â€¢ Summary cards: avg. stress, total sessions, total time

- **Profile & Settings**  
  â€¢ View and edit profile (picture, member info)   
  â€¢ Secure signâ€‘in / signâ€‘up with Firebase Authentication

- **Soothing Vibrations**  
  â€¢ Enable vibrations within Slinky when stress spikes  
  â€¢ Calibrate your baseline variance levels to personalize detection

# Slinky Bluetooth Stress Monitor

An Arduino-based system that monitors Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) to detect stress levels and communicates via Bluetooth with a companion mobile app. When stress is detected, the system triggers vibration motors in a wearable "Slinky" device.

## Features
- **GSR Stress Detection**: Measures skin conductance via analog sensor
- **Bluetooth (BLE) Communication**: Sends real-time data to a mobile app
- **Vibration Feedback**: Activates motors when stress is detected
- **Baseline Calibration**: Auto-calibrates to the user's normal levels

## Hardware Setup
### Components Needed
- Seeeduino Board
- Grove BLE v1 Bluetooth module
- Grove GSR sensor
- Vibration motors
- Battery

### Software
- Arduino IDE
- Serial Monitor App


## Software Configuration
### Arduino Code
The main code (`bluetoothAppConnect.ino`) handles:
1. BLE module initialization
2. GSR baseline calibration (10-second process)
3. Continuous stress monitoring
4. Vibration motor control
5. Bluetooth data transmission

Key Functions:
```arduino
void setup() {
  // Initializes BLE with commands:
  // AT+CLEAR, AT+ROLE0, AT+NAMESlinky
  // Performs 10-second GSR baseline calibration
}

void loop() {
  // 1. Checks BLE for incoming data
  // 2. Reads GSR sensor every 200ms
  // 3. Calculates variance from baseline
  // 4. Triggers motors if variance > 100
  // 5. Sends variance data via BLE
}
```

## Mobile App Connection
### Pair the Device
- Look for "Slinky" in your Bluetooth settings
### Data Format
- Incoming: Variance:[value] (stress level)

### Calibration Process
- Place the Slinky around your neck
- The system automatically runs 10-second calibration
- Baseline value is stored in userBaseline
- Subsequent readings compare to this baseline
